A quick and easy python project, this is simply meant to track calisthenics workouts day 
to day. I found that after I started working in an office that going to the gym for a few
hours every single day wasn't practical, but I wanted some way to track my fitness goals. 
The purpose of this program is to create a file for workouts, or append to a workout text
document, and add each workout. I used the exercises that I was doing at the office throughout
the day in order to track each movement.
